![Pierre_ciseaux_feuille_lézard_spock_aligned.svg](/rpsls.svg)

RPSLS is an extension to the original game of rock-paper-scissors. The additional characters were added by [Sam Kass and Karen Bryla](http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html) before being adopted, reordered, and [overpopularised by The Big Bang Theory](http://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/Rock_Paper_Scissors_Lizard_Spock).

## The rules

Scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. Rock crushes scissors.

## Why?

This is a React & Redux project, hosted at firebase. It was made to practice those technologies in on a greenfield project and as a task given in a recruitment process.
